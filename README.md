## Tutorial Guide

This is a Stopwatch Project Tutorial. By building this project, you could learn the following knowledge:

- Learn how to listen to click event from DOM using `rxjs` - `fromEvent`
- Learn how to use `merge` from rxjs so you could centralize the logic for several observable
- Learn how to use `interval` from rxjs to update the stopwatch counter

## Solution

Checkout branch `solution-1` to see how I build it.

`git checkout solution-1`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
